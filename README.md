# ORIFICE

ORIFICE is a pc (will gain mobile support soon!) story-based adventure game with a vivid storyline for the player to uncover. Anything can happen in those depths, and it's all up to you to decide what happens.

The objective is basically just exploration. there are 10 underground passages to explore, multiple crypts to sift through, and the game could technically end in any of the 10 locations. You could end up facing the wrath of whatever lurks in WAKELAND to become the beloved hero of the roo-rats in TRIBBETHERE. There are way more ways to end the game than the intended path.

# HOW TO RUN GAME
The pre-alpha of the game is only browser supported as of now, and is only intended for testers.
